## Phase 1: Security Hardening & Init Improvements

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-14

### Security (CRITICAL Fixes)

- **OAuth Email Domain Restriction** (CRITICAL)
  - Fixed `OAUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAIN` not being read from .env file
  - OAuth2-Proxy now properly restricts access to configured email domains
  - Prevents unauthorized access from non-domain email addresses

- **OAuth Client ID Configuration** (CRITICAL)
  - Fixed `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` environment variable not being used
  - OAuth2-Proxy now reads client ID from secrets/oauth-client-id file
  - Ensures proper OAuth application identification

- **Traefik API Security** (HIGH)
  - Disabled Traefik insecure API mode (`--api.insecure=false`)
  - API now only accessible via authenticated dashboard endpoint
  - Prevents unauthorized API access from port 8080

- **File Permissions Hardening**
  - Set .env file to 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
  - Set all Docker secrets files to 600 permissions
  - Restricted secrets directory to 700 permissions
  - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive configuration

### Added

- **DNS Validation Functions** (`assets/lib/common.sh`)
  - `validate_dns_resolution()` - Validates domain resolves correctly
  - `get_public_ip()` - Retrieves server's public IP from multiple sources
  - `get_dns_ip()` - Gets IP address from DNS lookup
  - `validate_dns_points_to_server()` - Verifies DNS points to correct server

- **SSL Certificate Functions** (`assets/lib/common.sh`)
  - `check_ssl_certificate_file()` - Validates certificate file has data
  - `wait_for_ssl_certificates()` - Waits for SSL acquisition with progress
  - `get_ssl_certificate_status()` - Returns active/staging/pending status

- **Init Script Enhancements** (`assets/lib/setup.sh`)
  - `validate_dns_prerequisites()` - Pre-flight DNS validation before deployment
  - `wait_for_ssl_certificates_wrapper()` - Waits for SSL after service start
  - Staging mode support with `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING` environment variable
  - Creates `acme-staging.json` for staging mode certificates
  - Enhanced completion message with SSL status indicators

### Changed

- **Init Flow Improvements**
  - Added DNS validation step before starting services
  - Fails early with clear error if DNS not configured
  - Waits up to 2 minutes for SSL certificate acquisition
  - Shows real-time progress during certificate requests
  - Displays SSL status in completion message

  - Clear remediation steps for common failures
  - Staging vs production mode clearly indicated
  - Migration guide for staging to production transition

- **Completion Message**

  - Provides troubleshooting commands when certificates pending
  - Shows migration steps when in staging mode
  - Includes security warnings for unauthenticated deployments

### Fixed

- Init script completing before SSL certificates obtained
- No validation that DNS was configured before attempting Let's Encrypt
- Confusing messages when using staging mode
- Missing guidance when SSL acquisition fails
