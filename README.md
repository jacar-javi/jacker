A production-ready Docker platform with integrated security, monitoring, and service orchestration.

## What is Jacker?

Jacker provides a complete home server management platform built on Docker, combining **Traefik v3** reverse proxy, **CrowdSec** security, **OAuth/Authentik** authentication, and comprehensive monitoring into a single, cohesive system. With 26 integrated services and modular architecture, Jacker makes self-hosting powerful applications simple and secure.

## Project Status

**Latest Release:** v1.0.0 - Production Ready (2025-10-14)

The Jacker platform has undergone comprehensive improvements across security, monitoring, and code quality:

- **Phase 1 (Security Hardening):** Fixed 3 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities in OAuth configuration and Traefik setup
- **Phase 2 (Monitoring Expansion):** Increased monitoring coverage from 40% to 96% (25 of 26 services monitored)
- **Phase 3 (Code Quality):** Hardened all shell scripts, added network IPAM configurations, and created pre-deployment validation

The platform is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security, comprehensive observability, and robust deployment processes.

### Key Features

- üìä **Complete Monitoring** - Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Alertmanager (96% service coverage)
- üê≥ **26 Integrated Services** - Ready-to-use platform components
- üì¶ **Stack Management** - Install additional applications with one command
- üöÄ **Quick Setup** - Get running in under 5 minutes with DNS validation
- üîß **Modular Architecture** - Easy to customize and extend
- ‚úÖ **Pre-Deployment Validation** - Automated checks prevent deployment failures
- üîç **Blackbox Monitoring** - HTTPS endpoint and SSL certificate expiry monitoring
- üåê **Network IPAM** - Predictable IP allocation with defined subnets

## Prerequisites

Before installing Jacker, ensure your system meets these requirements:

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, or similar)
- **Docker**: Version 24.0 or higher
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.20 or higher
- **Memory**: Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB+ recommended for production)
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 20GB free space (50GB+ recommended)
- **CPU**: 2+ cores recommended

### Access Requirements

- **sudo/root access**: Required for:
  - Setting directory permissions during initial setup
  - Installing Docker (if not already installed)
  - Configuring system networking (optional)

### Network Requirements

- **Domain Name**: A registered domain with DNS access
- **DNS Configuration**: Ability to create A records pointing to your server
- **Open Ports**:
  - Port 80 (HTTP) - for Let's Encrypt validation
  - Port 443 (HTTPS) - for secure web access
  - These ports must not be used by other services (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

### DNS Setup (Required Before Installation)

Configure these DNS records before running the installer:

```
yourdomain.com              A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
*.yourdomain.com            A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Or individual records for each service:

```
traefik.yourdomain.com      A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
grafana.yourdomain.com      A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
portainer.yourdomain.com    A    YOUR_SERVER_IP
(etc.)
```

DNS propagation can take 5-60 minutes. Verify with:
```bash
nslookup traefik.yourdomain.com
```

### Optional Requirements

- **OAuth Provider** (Google, GitHub, etc.) - For authentication
- **SMTP Server** - For email alerts
- **Telegram/Slack** - For chat notifications

### Checking Prerequisites

Run the validation script to check your system:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

This will verify:
- Docker and Docker Compose versions
- Available disk space and memory
- Port availability
- DNS configuration (if domain is set)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jacar-javi/jacker.git
cd jacker

# Validate prerequisites
./scripts/validate.sh

# Run installer (choose Quick or Advanced setup)
./jacker init

# Check health
./jacker health

# Access your services
# https://yourdomain.com - Homepage dashboard
# https://traefik.yourdomain.com - Traefik dashboard
# https://grafana.yourdomain.com - Grafana monitoring
```

That's it! Your Jacker platform is now running with all 26 services ready to use with valid SSL certificates.
