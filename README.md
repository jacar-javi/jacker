# Jacker :heart:

Jacker :heart: = jacar + docker

Project Jacker :heart: is a powerful Docker stack combining Traefik and CrowdSec for enhanced security in your production public sites hosting, and Google Oauth for SSO to your management and monitoring tools.

Jacker is also intended to be a solid foundation on which to host new stacks of Docker-based components, establishing a series of foundations, standards and good practices to guarantee the security and stability necessary for any production system.
