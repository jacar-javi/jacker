## Overview

All services are accessible via Traefik reverse proxy at `https://<service>.$PUBLIC_FQDN` where `$PUBLIC_FQDN` is your configured domain (e.g., `myserver.example.com`).

**Total Services:** 20 compose files
**Architecture:** Modular service inclusion via `docker-compose.yml`

## Core Infrastructure

### üîÄ traefik.yml
**Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer**

- **Image:** `traefik:v3.5.5`
- **URL:** `https://traefik.$PUBLIC_FQDN`
- **Ports:** 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS/TCP), 443 (HTTPS/UDP for HTTP/3)
- **Purpose:** Dynamic reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/traefik/`
- **Description:** Traefik acts as the gateway for all services in Jacker, routing external requests to the appropriate containers based on domain names. It automatically discovers new services via Docker labels, generates and renews SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt, and handles HTTP to HTTPS redirects. Traefik also provides built-in load balancing, circuit breakers, and request middleware chains for authentication. The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of routes, services, and middleware.
- **Docs:** https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/

### üîå socket-proxy.yml
**Docker Socket Proxy**

- **Image:** `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest`
- **Port:** 2375 (internal)
- **Purpose:** Secure proxy for Docker socket to limit Traefik's access
- **Description:** The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) provides full control over Docker, which poses a security risk if exposed directly to containers. Socket Proxy creates a secure intermediary that only allows specific Docker API operations. It restricts Traefik and other services to read-only access for service discovery, preventing them from executing dangerous operations like container deletion or volume mounting. This follows the principle of least privilege for enhanced security.
- **Docs:** https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy

### üóÑÔ∏è postgres.yml
**PostgreSQL Database**

- **Image:** `postgres:17-alpine`
- **Port:** 5432 (internal)
- **Purpose:** Database for CrowdSec and other services
- **Database:** `crowdsec_db`
- **Secrets:** Uses Docker secrets for passwords
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/postgres/`
- **Description:** PostgreSQL provides reliable, ACID-compliant relational database storage for Jacker services. It stores CrowdSec's decision engine data (blocked IPs, scenarios, alerts), user credentials for Authentik, and can be used by custom applications. The Alpine-based image keeps the footprint small while maintaining full PostgreSQL features. Automated backups and health checks ensure data integrity and availability. Includes pgBackRest for advanced backup and recovery.
- **Docs:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/

### üî¥ redis.yml
**Redis Cache**

- **Image:** `redis:7-alpine`
- **Port:** 6379 (internal)
- **Purpose:** In-memory cache for authentication sessions
- **Secrets:** Uses Docker secrets for passwords
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/redis/`
- **Description:** Redis provides ultra-fast in-memory data storage for authentication session management. It stores OAuth tokens, user session data, and can be used for rate limiting and temporary data caching. The in-memory architecture delivers sub-millisecond response times, making authentication checks nearly instantaneous. Redis also supports persistence to disk, ensuring session data survives container restarts without users needing to re-authenticate. Includes Redis Exporter for Prometheus metrics.
- **Docs:** https://redis.io/docs/

## Authentication & Security

### üîê oauth.yml
**OAuth2 Authentication (Default)**

- **Image:** `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:v7.7.1`
- **URL:** `https://auth.$PUBLIC_FQDN`
- **Purpose:** OAuth2 forward authentication for Traefik
- **Required Env:** `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (stored in .env)
- **Required Secrets:** `oauth_client_secret`, `oauth_cookie_secret`
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/oauth2-proxy/`
- **Description:** OAuth2 Proxy provides secure authentication using your existing Google, GitHub, or other OAuth2 providers. When users access protected services, they're redirected to the OAuth provider for login, then back to the service after verification. Access is restricted to whitelisted email addresses, making it perfect for personal or small team deployments. The forward authentication pattern means no modifications are needed to individual services - Traefik handles authentication centrally. Session tokens are cached in Redis for fast subsequent access. Now using the official oauth2-proxy for better security and feature support.
- **Docs:** https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/

### üîë authentik.yml
**Authentik (Alternative Self-Hosted Auth)**

- **Image:** `ghcr.io/goauthentik/server:${AUTHENTIK_VERSION:-2024.10.4}`
- **URL:** `https://auth.${DOMAINNAME}`
- **Purpose:** Advanced self-hosted identity provider (SSO, MFA, LDAP, SAML)
- **Setup:** Run `./jacker config authentik` or `./assets/setup-authentik.sh`
- **Secrets:** Uses Docker secrets for `authentik_secret_key`, `authentik_postgres_password`
- **Description:** Authentik is a powerful, self-hosted identity provider that offers enterprise-grade features without external dependencies. It supports multiple authentication protocols (OAuth2, SAML, LDAP), multi-factor authentication (TOTP, WebAuthn, SMS), user self-service portals, and policy-based access control. Authentik can integrate with existing LDAP directories, provide SSO for dozens of applications, and offers a visual flow designer for customizing authentication workflows. Choose Authentik over OAuth when you need MFA, user management, or want complete control over authentication data.
- **Docs:** https://goauthentik.io/docs/

### üõ°Ô∏è crowdsec.yml
**CrowdSec IPS/IDS**

- **Image:** `crowdsecurity/crowdsec:v1.7.0`

- **Database:** Uses PostgreSQL
- **Secrets:** Uses Docker secrets for database password and API keys
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/crowdsec/`
- **Description:** CrowdSec is a modern, collaborative intrusion prevention system that protects your server from attacks. It analyzes logs from various sources (Traefik, SSH, web servers) using behavior-based scenarios to detect malicious activity like brute-force attacks, port scans, and exploitation attempts. Detected attackers are automatically blocked, and threat intelligence is shared with the CrowdSec community, creating a global protection network. CrowdSec includes pre-built scenarios for common attacks and can be extended with custom parsers and scenarios. It's like a neighborhood watch for your server.
- **Docs:** https://docs.crowdsec.net/

### üö´ traefik-bouncer.yml
**CrowdSec Traefik Bouncer**

- **Image:** `fbonalair/traefik-crowdsec-bouncer:0.5.0`
- **Purpose:** Blocks malicious IPs detected by CrowdSec
- **Depends on:** crowdsec
- **Secrets:** Uses Docker secrets for bouncer API key
- **Description:** The Traefik Bouncer connects CrowdSec's decision engine to Traefik's middleware system, automatically blocking requests from IP addresses that CrowdSec has identified as malicious. When CrowdSec detects an attack pattern, the bouncer updates Traefik's IP whitelist in real-time, preventing further requests from the attacker. This creates an automated defense system that responds to threats without manual intervention, blocking attacks at the edge before they reach your services.
- **Docs:** https://github.com/fbonalair/traefik-crowdsec-bouncer

### üîå traefik-crowdsec-plugin.yml
**CrowdSec Traefik Plugin**

- **Purpose:** Alternative CrowdSec integration via Traefik plugin
- **Description:** This provides an alternative method of integrating CrowdSec with Traefik using Traefik's native plugin system instead of an external bouncer container. The plugin checks incoming requests against CrowdSec's Local API directly from within Traefik's middleware chain. Choose this over the bouncer if you prefer a more integrated solution or want to reduce the number of running containers. Both approaches provide equivalent protection.
- **Docs:** https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin

- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/loki/`
- **Description:** Loki is Grafana's log aggregation system, designed to be cost-effective and easy to operate. Unlike traditional log systems that index log content, Loki only indexes metadata (labels), making it incredibly efficient. It receives logs from Promtail, stores them compressed, and provides a powerful query language (LogQL) for searching and filtering. Loki integrates directly with Grafana, allowing you to correlate logs with metrics on the same dashboard. Perfect for troubleshooting issues by viewing application and system logs in real-time.
- **Docs:** https://grafana.com/docs/loki/

### üì§ promtail.yml
**Promtail Log Shipper**

- **Image:** `grafana/promtail:3.5.5`
- **Purpose:** Collects and ships Docker logs to Loki
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/loki/`
- **Description:** Promtail is the log shipping agent that tails Docker container logs and sends them to Loki. It runs on each server, automatically discovering containers and reading their stdout/stderr logs. Promtail enriches logs with labels (container name, service, host) for easy filtering and adds metadata before forwarding to Loki. The configuration controls which logs to collect, how to parse them, and what labels to attach. Promtail is lightweight and designed to have minimal performance impact.
- **Docs:** https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/

### üîî alertmanager.yml
**Alertmanager**

- **Image:** `prom/alertmanager:v0.28.1`
- **Port:** 9093 (internal)
- **Purpose:** Alert routing and notification management
- **Config:** Uses Docker configs from `config/alertmanager/`
- **Secrets:** Can use Docker secrets for notification credentials
- **Description:** Alertmanager handles alerts generated by Prometheus, providing deduplication, grouping, and routing to notification channels. When Prometheus detects a problem (high CPU, disk full, service down), it sends an alert to Alertmanager, which then notifies you via email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other integrations. Alertmanager prevents alert fatigue by grouping similar alerts, silencing alerts during maintenance windows, and managing alert escalation. It ensures you're notified about critical issues without being overwhelmed by noise.
- **Docs:** https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/

### üíª node-exporter.yml
**Node Exporter**

### Docker Configs

Services use Docker configs for immutable configuration management:

```yaml
configs:
  traefik_yml:
    file: ${CONFIGDIR}/traefik/traefik.yml
  # ... more configs
```

Benefits:
- Configuration versioning
- Atomic updates
- Separation from runtime data
- Better security (read-only mounts)

## Docker Secrets

Sensitive data is managed through Docker secrets for enhanced security:
