# ShellCheck configuration for Jacker project
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Disable SC2155 - "Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values"
# Rationale: This is a style preference. The codebase consistently uses
# `local var=$(command)` for readability. All critical scripts use
# `set -euo pipefail` for proper error handling, making this safe.
disable=SC2155

# Disable SC2154 - "Variable is referenced but not assigned"
# Rationale: Variables are sourced from library files (common.sh for colors)
# or from .env files (OAUTH_*, POSTGRES_*, etc.). These are intentionally
# loaded from external sources and ShellCheck cannot trace them.
disable=SC2154

# Disable SC2034 - "Variable appears unused"
# Rationale: Some variables are used externally, exported, or reserved
# for future use. Will be handled case-by-case.
disable=SC2034

# Disable SC2005 - "Useless echo"
# Rationale: Sometimes echo $(cmd) is used for clarity
disable=SC2005

# Note: SC1091 (Not following .env) and SC1090 (Can't follow non-constant source)
# are handled with per-file directives using # shellcheck source=/dev/null

# Enable all other checks
enable=all

# Set shell dialect
shell=bash

# Additional options
# Use `source=path` directives in individual files for dynamic sourcing
